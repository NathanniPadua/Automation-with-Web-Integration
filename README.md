# Automation-with-Web-Integration
Automation Challenge with Web Integration using Python

## Challenge:

We work at an importer and the price of our products is linked to a quote from:

* Dollar
* Euro
* Gold

We need to automatically get the price of these 3 items from the internet and know how much we should charge for our products, 
considering a contribution margin that we have in our database.
